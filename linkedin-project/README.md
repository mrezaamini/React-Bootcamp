## Getting Started

To get started with the LinkedIn Clone project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by navigating to the project's directory and running:

```shell
npm install
```

2. Create a Firebase project and set up authentication and a database. Refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs) for detailed instructions.

3. Update the Firebase configuration in the project's code to connect it with your Firebase project.

4. Start the development server:

```shell
npm start
```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see the LinkedIn Clone application running.

## Project Structure

The LinkedIn Clone project follows a typical React project structure. Here's an overview of the project's structure and important directories:

- `src`: Includes different features/modules/components of the LinkedIn Clone, such as the feed, sidebar, news and more.
- `src/redux`: Contains the Redux store configuration and actions/reducers for managing the application state.
- `src/firebase`: Includes the Firebase configuration and helper functions for interacting with Firebase services.
- `src/App.js`: The entry point of the application where components are rendered and routed.
- `src/index.js`: The root file that renders the React application.

Feel free to explore and modify the project structure as needed while keeping the core functionality intact.

## Technologies

The LinkedIn project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: The foundation of the project, allowing for the creation of reusable UI components and managing the application's state using React Hooks.
- **Firebase**: A cloud-based platform that provides authentication services, a real-time database, and hosting capabilities.
- **Redux**: A state management library that helps manage the application's global state and enables predictable data flow.
- **Authentication**: Firebase's authentication service is used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Flip Move**: A React animation library used for smooth transitions when adding or removing items from lists.
